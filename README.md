Modelled a percolation system using an N-by-N grid of sites. Each site is
either open or blocked. A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites. We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row.

Percolation is implemented via Breadth First Search as well as Depth First Search.
